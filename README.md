1. Assembly calculator is a simple single digit calcularo project with multiple operators available which can be runned on any Debian-based system (like Ubuntu) with NASM shell installed on it 

2. Borrow book is a borrow book app writeen in C# the user is needed Visual Studio to run the project, the login and password are admin and 123

3. C++ SDL graphics project which generates a simple 3D figure image and can be runned on any IDE which supports C++ and SDL library

4. The Door&Lock is a code and PDF document with description to my old Arduino project for door lock with code system. It can be runned on simulators like Tinkercad or real Arduino circuit :)

5. GameOfLife is a Conway's Game of life algorithm with an actual animation of a process writeen in Python. Pycharm is required to run it

6. GeneticAlgorithmSolution is an Python app which uses genetic algorithm to solve 8 queens problem. It uses the following elements of the algorithm:

   8-digit integer-value genome

   The fitness function of the form: f(configuration) = 28-number_of_attacks(configuration)

   the genetic operators (roulette wheel selection, two-site crossover, mutation)


7. GeoPulse application is a navigation application created with Python programming language and using OpenCage and OpenRoute services for converting actual addresses into coordinates points and Folium for the usage of interactive map, 

8. JokeFactory is a simple app written in Python which multiple comedians, multiple audience members and bounded joke buffer.

	The server takes the following parameter
		BUFFER_SIZE  (INTEGER)  number of buffer slots, each capable of storing exactly one joke.
		NUM_COMEDIANS (INTEGER) number of processes/threads coming up with jokes
		SOPHISTICATION (INTEGER) a maximum of a random number of seconds that it takes for a comedian to come up with a new joke

	Clients connect to the server in one of the modes
		* greedy mode = take all jokes as they are produced
		* fresh joke mode = always take the most recently produced one
		* take whatever joke that has not been received yet 

9. The N_Queens is an app written in Python which can solve the puzzle of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, the user can manually enter the n value. Pycharm is required to run it

10. SimpleAndroidProject is a project writeen in C# with a set of simple features like revert of the string and a calculator which asks the user to choose the app for each operator. Requires an installed Android Stuido to use

11. StudentService project is a project created with a use of .NET framework and MySQL data base and which allows the user to manage different kind of students data. To run it you would need both Visual Studio and MySQL data base installed locally. 

To use it: 

11.1 Import the "degreeproject" folder into your MySQL data base 

11.2 Go to the "Student Service" folder inside the project and in all files with ".cs" extension edit the connstr variable with your actual data base name, user and password

11.3 Open the project solution file in Visual Studio

11.4 The login and password for manager role is UN1@uni.com and 1234, by using it you can add the student users with their own passwords and ids

12. SortingC++ is a C++ project which can be oppened in CodeBlocks. It compares merge sort, heap sort and quick sort algorithms execution speed in nanoseconds for sorted and shuffled arrays with the same input data. These algorithms are tested on arrays from size 100 to 10000. In the "Description" file inside the project folder you also find the brief review for each algorithm (Brute Force, Sunday, KMP, FSM, Rabin Karp) from 2021 me:

13. PatternSearchC++ is a project for finding the patterns in text using different algorithms which can be as well oppened using the CodeBlocks. The detailed information about it together with my small research can be found in the "SortingAlgorithmMaksymSemko" word file inside the project folder

14. C++ConsoleBankApp and C++ConsoleTaxApp are simple C++ console projects which implement double quque data structure and imitate a service for collecting taxes and a bank system (can be openned in CodeBlocks as the previously mentioned projects)

15. C++StudentConsoleApp is a one more simple C++ console project which uses linked list and imitates student service

16. EmotionDetection the UI application which detects multiple emotions in the text provided by the user and uses excel file which is filled with twitter comments for machine learning( I don't remember in which repository or website I found this file). The user is able to select one of the three machine learning algorithms for emotions detection from the appeared UI window, after selecting it, the data file will start to be generated, after generation is completed user can type any text and press "detect" button to detect emotions in text. If user would want to use other algorithms after that, he would need to manually remove the previousl data set file and restart the application. PyCharm is required to to build and run this application.
