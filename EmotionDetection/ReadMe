EmotionDetection is the desktop UI application which detects multiple emotions in the text provided by user and uses excel file which is filled with twitter comments as a training dataset for machine learning
(I don't remember in which repository or website I have found this file). The user is able to select one of the three available machine learning algorithms for emotions detection from the appeared UI window.
After selecting it, the trained dataset file will start to be generated, after generation is completed user can type in any text and press "detect" button to detect emotions in text. 
If user would want to use other algorithms after that, he would need to manually remove the previously generated data set file and restart the application. PyCharm is required to build and run this application.
