SortingC++ is a C++ project which can be oppened in CodeBlocks. It compares merge sort, heap sort and quick sort algorithms execution speed in nanoseconds for sorted and shuffled arrays with the same input data. These algorithms are tested on arrays from size 100 to 10000. In the "Description" file inside the project folder you also find the brief review for each algorithm (Brute Force, Sunday, KMP, FSM, Rabin Karp) from 2021 me:
