GeneticAlgorithmSolution is an Python app which uses genetic algorithm to solve 8 queens problem. It uses the following elements of the algorithm:

8-digit integer-value genome

The fitness function of the form: f(configuration) = 28-number_of_attacks(configuration)

the genetic operators (roulette wheel selection, two-site crossover, mutation)
